Supervised learning: \n Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. The given data is labeled. Both classification and regression problems are supervised learning problems. \n \n Example – Consider the following data regarding patients entering a clinic . The data consists of the gender and age of the patients and each patient is labeled as “healthy” or “sick”. \n \n \n \n \n \n Gender \n Age \n Label \n \n \n M \n 48 \n sick \n \n \n M \n 67 \n sick \n \n \n F \n 53 \n healthy \n \n \n M \n 49 \n sick \n \n \n F \n 32 \n healthy \n \n \n M \n 34 \n healthy \n \n \n M \n 21 \n healthy \n \n \n \n 2. Unsupervised learning: \n Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. In unsupervised learning algorithms, classification or categorization is not included in the observations. Example: Consider the following data regarding patients entering a clinic. The data consists of the gender and age of the patients. \n \n \n \n \n Gender \n Age \n \n \n M \n 48 \n \n \n M \n 67 \n \n \n F \n 53 \n \n \n M \n 49 \n \n \n F \n 34 \n \n \n M \n 21 \n \n \n \n As a kind of learning, it resembles the methods humans use to figure out that certain objects or events are from the same class, such as by observing the degree of similarity between objects. Some recommendation systems that you find on the web in the form of marketing automation are based on this type of learning. \n \n To know more about supervised and unsupervised learning refer to: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-unsupervised-learning/ . \n \n 3. Reinforcement learning : \n Reinforcement learning is the problem of getting an agent to act in the world so as to maximize its rewards. \n A learner is not told what actions to take as in most forms of machine learning but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. For example — Consider teaching a dog a new trick: we cannot tell him what to do, what not to do, but we can reward/punish it if it does the right/wrong thing. \n When watching the video, notice how the program is initially clumsy and unskilled but steadily improves with training until it becomes a champion. \n \n To know more about Reinforcement learning refer to: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-reinforcement-learning/ . \n \n 4. Semi-supervised learning : \n Where an incomplete training signal is given: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. There is a special case of this principle known as Transduction where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time, except that part of the targets are missing. Semi-supervised learning is an approach to machine learning that combines small labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning and supervised learning. \n Categorizing based on Required Output \n Another categorization of machine-learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system: \n \n Classification : When inputs are divided into two or more classes, the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are “spam” and “not spam”. \n Regression : This is also a supervised problem, A case when the outputs are continuous rather than discrete. \n Clustering : When a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task. \n \n Examples of Machine Learning in Action \n Machine learning is woven into the fabric of our daily lives. Here are some examples to illustrate its diverse applications \n Supervised Learning \n \n Filtering Your Inbox: Spam filters use machine learning to analyze emails and identify spam based on past patterns. They learn from emails you mark as spam and not spam, becoming more accurate over time. \n Recommending Your Next Purchase: E-commerce platforms and streaming services use machine learning to analyze your purchase history and viewing habits. This allows them to recommend products and shows you’re more likely to enjoy. \n Smart Reply in Emails: Machine learning powers features like “Smart Reply” in Gmail, suggesting short responses based on the content of the email. \n \n Unsupervised Learning \n \n Grouping Customers: Machine learning can analyze customer data (purchase history, demographics) to identify customer segments with similar characteristics. This helps businesses tailor marketing campaigns and product offerings. \n Anomaly Detection: Financial institutions use machine learning to detect unusual spending patterns on your credit card, potentially indicating fraudulent activity. \n Image Classification in Photos: Facial recognition in photos on social media platforms is powered by machine learning algorithms trained on vast amounts of labeled data. \n \n Beyond Categories \n \n Self-Driving Cars: These rely on reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning where algorithms learn through trial and error in a simulated environment. \n Medical Diagnosis: Machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images (X-rays, MRIs) to identify abnormalities and aid doctors in diagnosis. \n \n Benefits and Challenges of Machine Learning \n Machine learning (ML) has become a transformative technology across various industries. While it offers numerous advantages, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges that come with its increasing use. \n Benefits of Machine Learning \n \n Enhanced Efficiency and Automation: ML automates repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex work. It also streamlines processes, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. \n Data-Driven Insights: ML can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that humans might miss. This allows for better decision-making based on real-world data. \n Improved Personalization: ML personalizes user experiences across various platforms. From recommendation systems to targeted advertising, ML tailors content and services to individual preferences. \n Advanced Automation and Robotics: ML empowers robots and machines to perform complex tasks with greater accuracy and adaptability. This is revolutionizing fields like manufacturing and logistics. \n \n Challenges of Machine Learning \n \n Data Bias and Fairness: ML algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. Biased data can lead to discriminatory outcomes, requiring careful data selection and monitoring of algorithms. \n Security and Privacy Concerns: As ML relies heavily on data, security breaches can expose sensitive information. Additionally, the use of personal data raises privacy concerns that need to be addressed. \n Interpretability and Explainability: Complex ML models can be difficult to understand, making it challenging to explain their decision-making processes. This lack of transparency can raise questions about accountability and trust. \n Job Displacement and Automation: Automation through ML can lead to job displacement in certain sectors. Addressing the need for retraining and reskilling the workforce is crucial. \n \n Conclusion \n In conclusion, machine learning is a powerful technology that allows computers to learn without explicit programming. By exploring different learning tasks and their applications, we gain a deeper understanding of how machine learning is shaping our world. From filtering your inbox to diagnosing diseases, machine learning is making a significant impact on various aspects of our lives. \n \n \n Please Login to comment...",

        "content": "This webpage describes how to take user input in Python.  The primary function is `input()`, which always returns a string.  To get numbers, you must explicitly convert the input using `int()` or `float()`.  The article provides examples of taking string, integer, and float inputs, and also notes that  `input()` halts program execution until the user provides input and presses Enter.  The article also includes a FAQ section addressing how to input numbers and characters specifically.  The provided text is not related to machine learning.\n\n\nLast Updated : \n 02 Jan, 2025 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Developers often have a need to interact with users, either to get data or to provide some sort of result. Most programs today use a dialog box as a way of asking the user to provide some type of input. While Python provides us with two inbuilt functions to read the input from the keyboard. \n input () function first takes the input from the user and converts it into a string. The type of the returned object always will be &lt;class ‘str’&gt;. It does not evaluate the expression it just returns the complete statement as String. \n For example, Python provides a built-in function called input which takes the input from the user. When the input function is called it stops the program and waits for the user’s input. When the user presses enter, the program resumes and returns what the user typed. \n Output: \n \n Taking String as an input: \n Output: \n What is your name? Ram Ram How the input function works in Python : \n When input() function executes program flow will be stopped until the user has given input. The text or message displayed on the output screen to ask a user to enter an input value is optional i.e. the prompt, which will be printed on the screen is optional. Whatever you enter as input, the input function converts it into a string. if you enter an integer value still input() function converts it into a string. You need to explicitly convert it into an integer in your code using typecasting . Code: \n Output: \n \n Note: input() function takes all the input as a string only \n There are various function that are used to take as desired input few of them are : – \n int(input()) float(input()) Output: \n Output Refer to the article Taking list as input from the user for more information. \n Taking Input in Python – FAQs How to input a number in Python? You can use the input() function to accept user input. Convert the input to an integer or float using int() or float() if necessary. \n # Input a number num = input(\"Enter a number: \") # Convert input to integer num = int(num) How to take character input in Python? You can use the input() function to accept user input. Characters are inherently strings in Python, so no additional conversion is necessary. \n # Input a character char = input(\"Enter a character: \") How to check input type in Python? You can use the type() function to check the type of input received from input(). \n user_input = input(\"Enter something: \") print(type(user_input)) How to print input value in Python? Simply use the print() function to display the input value. \n user_input = input(\"Enter something: \") print(\"You entered:\", user_input) How to input time in Python? You can use the input() function to accept a string input representing time. You can then parse and manipulate this string using datetime functions if needed. \n import datetime # Input time as string time_str = input(\"Enter a time (HH:MM:SS): \") # Convert string to datetime object time_obj = datetime.datetime.strptime(time_str, \"%H:%M:%S\")",

Ram Ram How the input function works in Python : \n When input() function executes program flow will be stopped until the user has given input. The text or message displayed on the output screen to ask a user to enter an input value is optional i.e. the prompt, which will be printed on the screen is optional. Whatever you enter as input, the input function converts it into a string. if you enter an integer value still input() function converts it into a string. You need to explicitly convert it into an integer in your code using typecasting . Code: \n Output: \n \n Note: input() function takes all the input as a string only \n There are various function that are used to take as desired input few of them are : – \n int(input()) float(input()) Output: \n Output Refer to the article Taking list as input from the user for more information. \n Taking Input in Python – FAQs How to input a number in Python? You can use the input() function to accept user input. Convert the input to an integer or float using int() or float() if necessary. \n # Input a number num = input(\"Enter a number: \") # Convert input to integer num = int(num) How to take character input in Python? You can use the input() function to accept user input. Characters are inherently strings in Python, so no additional conversion is necessary. \n # Input a character char = input(\"Enter a character: \") How to check input type in Python? You can use the type() function to check the type of input received from input(). \n user_input = input(\"Enter something: \") print(type(user_input)) How to print input value in Python? Simply use the print() function to display the input value. \n user_input = input(\"Enter something: \") print(\"You entered:\", user_input) How to input time in Python? You can use the input() function to accept a string input representing time. You can then parse and manipulate this string using datetime functions if needed. \n import datetime # Input time as string time_str = input(\"Enter a time (HH:MM:SS): \") # Convert string to datetime object time_obj = datetime.datetime.strptime(time_str, \"%H:%M:%S\")",

        "content": "This document is about Python strings, not machine learning.  It covers creating strings using single, double, or triple quotes (for multi-line strings), accessing characters via indexing (including negative indexing), string slicing, and the immutability of Python strings (meaning they can't be changed in place).  The document does not contain information relevant to an introduction to machine learning.\n\n\nLast Updated : \n 31 Dec, 2024 \n \n \n A string is a sequence of characters. Python treats anything inside quotes as a string. This includes letters, numbers, and symbols. Python has no character data type so single character is a string of length 1. \n In this example, s holds the value “GfG” and is defined as a string. \n Table of Content \n Creating a String Accessing characters in Python String String Immutability Deleting a String Updating a String Common String Methods Concatenating and Repeating Strings Formatting Strings Creating a String Strings can be created using either single (‘) or double (“) quotes. \n Multi-line Strings If we need a string to span multiple lines then we can use triple quotes (”’ or “””) . \n Output I am Learning\nPython String on GeeksforGeeks\nI'm a\nGeek\n Accessing characters in Python String Strings in Python are sequences of characters, so we can access individual characters using indexing. Strings are indexed starting from 0 and -1 from end . This allows us to retrieve specific characters from the string. \n Python String syntax indexing Note: Accessing an index out of range will cause an IndexError . Only integers are allowed as indices and using a float or other types will result in a TypeError . \n Access string with Negative Indexing Python allows negative address references to access characters from back of the String, e.g. -1 refers to the last character, -2 refers to the second last character, and so on. \n String Slicing Slicing is a way to extract portion of a string by specifying the start and end indexes. The syntax for slicing is string[start:end] , where start starting index and end is stopping index (excluded). \n Output eek\nGee\nksforGeeks\nskeeGrofskeeG\n String Immutability Strings in Python are immutable . This means that they cannot be changed after they are created. If we need to manipulate strings then we can use methods like concatenation, slicing, or formatting to create new strings based on the original. \n Deleting a String In Python, it is not possible to delete individual characters from a string since strings are immutable. However, we can delete an entire string variable using the del keyword. \n Note: After deleting the string using del and if we try to access s then it will result in a NameError because the variable no longer exists. \n Updating a String To update a part of a string we need to create a new string since strings are immutable. \n Output Hello geeks\nhello GeeksforGeeks\n Explanation: \n For s1, The original string s is sliced from index 1 to end of string and then concatenate “H” to create a new string s1 . For s2, we can created a new string s2 and used replace() method to replace ‘geeks’ with ‘GeeksforGeeks’. Common String Methods Python provides a various built-in methods to manipulate strings. Below are some of the most useful methods. \n len() : The len() function returns the total number of characters in a string. \n upper() and lower() : upper() method converts all characters to uppercase. lower() method converts all characters to lowercase. \n Output HELLO WORLD\nhello world\n strip() and replace() : strip() removes leading and trailing whitespace from the string and replace(old, new) replaces all occurrences of a specified substring with another. \n Output Gfg\nPython is awesome\n To learn more about string methods, please refer to Python String Methods . \n Concatenating and Repeating Strings We can concatenate strings using + operator and repeat them using * operator . \n Strings can be combined by using + operator . \n We can repeat a string multiple times using * operator . \n Formatting Strings Python provides several ways to include variables inside strings. \n Using f-strings The simplest and most preferred way to format strings is by using f-strings . \n Output Name: Alice, Age: 22\n Using format() Another way to format strings is by using format() method. \n Output My name is Alice and I am 22 years old.\n Using in for String Membership Testing The in keyword checks if a particular substring is present in a string. \n Related Articles: \n Python String Methods Python String Exercise Escape characters in Python",

While OLL provides self-paced learning with progress tracking, it does *not* offer discussion forums, certificates, or the ability to transfer progress to edX.  To obtain a certificate or participate in discussions, you'll need to enroll in the corresponding course on edX.  The OLL is currently in its prototype phase, so expect ongoing development and new course additions.  For specific questions about courses, including information about future certificate offerings on edX, consult the individual course pages.  The library does not currently contain an \"Introduction to Machine Learning\" course.\n\n\nThe MIT Open Learning Library is home to selected educational content from MIT OpenCourseWare and MITx courses, available to anyone in the world at any time. All material is free to use. Some resources, particularly those from MIT OpenCourseWare, are free to download, remix, and reuse for non-commercial purposes. \n MIT is committed to sharing learning materials with the world. The Open Learning Library provides additional opportunities to learn from MIT at your own pace, as on MIT OpenCourseWare, while engaging with problems and receiving instant feedback. \n You will be able to keep track of your own progress in the course. The Open Learning Library does not include discussion forums, certificates, or the ability to transfer your progress to edX.org . For those hoping to participate in a discussion or seeking a credential for completing a course, we will do our best to highlight when a credential-bearing offering is available on edX.org . \n You’ve discovered us during our prototype phase. We hope you’ll come along for this journey. Over time, we will add new courses, develop site features, and enhance the user experience. We welcome your feedback on the site, including your thoughts on areas for improvement. Please email mitoll-support@mit.edu with your feedback or any requests for support. \n \n Frequently Asked Questions \n \n \n I did not receive my activation email, what do I do? \n Please check your SPAM and/or Junk folders to see if the activation email has been flagged as junk. If the email is not there, please visit the login page and use the 'forgot password' link to resend the activation email. If you still do not receive the email, please contact our support team at mitoll-support@mit.edu . \n \n \n Do I have to pay for access to any part of the site? \n No. There are no fees associated with the Open Learning Library. All content is freely accessible. \n \n \n Can I earn a certificate for a course on Open Learning Library? \n No. If you’re interested in earning a certificate in an MITx course, please visit edX.org and sign up for the next available certificate run of the course. We will strive to provide direct links to courses with a certificate option on edX.org whenever they are available. \n \n \n How can I find out when the next certificate run of a course will happen on edX.org? \n On each course About Page, you will see a banner with updated edX information on it, and a link through to the course there. Additionally, you can sign up for the MITx mailing list to receive information about all of our courses and programs. \n \n \n Do these courses have discussion forums or teaching assistants to answer my questions? \n No. The Open Learning Library provides only self-guided course materials. If you have a technical issue with the site, you can contact mitoll-support@mit.edu , but we will not have support staff available for topic-based questions. If you wish to join a discussion forum as you learn, please wait for the next run of the course you are interested in on edX.org. \n \n \n Do I have to create an account to access courses? \n It depends. We are using the Open edX platform for running course content on the Open Learning Library. Creating an account will allow you to access all courses, keep track of your progress, and see the answers you have submitted within the course. If you do not wish to create an account, we do offer several courses that do not require an account/registration but your course progress will not be tracked. \n \n \n Can I use my edx.org account? \n No. This is a separate site. \n \n \n I am looking for material that is not covered in the MIT Open Learning Library. Where can I find it? \n \n You can check at OCW or MITx on edX . \n \n \n \n How does the MIT Open Learning Library differ from MIT OpenCourseWare or MITx courses on edX? \n You can think of the three different resources as a spectrum of offerings utilizing MIT content for different types of learning experiences. On one end is edX.org — MITx courses on edX are end-to-end course experiences with certificates available for you to earn, live teaching support in a discussion forum, and start and end dates. On the other end is MIT OCW, which is a completely self-guided experience containing published content from MIT courses that is open all of the time and licensed for reuse, but that does not include any interactive content. Open Learning Library sits in between. As in many MITx courses, Open Learning Library provides interactive course experiences that include auto-graded assessments that give you instant feedback and allow you to track your progress as you work your way through learning the subject matter. Like OCW, this content is always open and self-guided and includes no live support, discussion forum, or certificates. \n \n \n I’m interested in a MicroMasters program. Are these courses part of the Open Learning Library? \n No. We are not offering any MicroMasters program content on the Open Learning Library. Please visit micromasters.mit.edu for more information on our programs. \n \n \n Can I download material from Open Learning Library? \n Only if the material is Creative Commons-licensed, as is the case for all material from MIT OpenCourseWare. \n \n \n I’m having a problem using the site. How can I get help? \n Send an email to mitoll-support@mit.edu and someone will get back to you within 1–2 business days. \n \n \n What type of licenses do these courses have? \n The courses here will have varying licenses, and you will see the license type indicated on the About Pages. Some courses will be All Rights Reserved, others Creative Commons, and some have mixed licenses. \n \n \n Who decides what content goes into each course? \n The MIT faculty member responsible for the course makes this decision on a case-by-case basis. This is why you may see different formats for each different course you access in the Open Learning Library. Most often, though, what you will see is the content and assessments that you need to work through in order to learn, while other assessments whose principal purpose is testing whether you have earned a certificate are only available on edX.org, where you can have the opportunity to earn a certificate. \n \n \n Why support Open Learning? \n \nEach course in the Open Learning Library is a collaborative effort by a team of MIT faculty, educational technologists, media specialists, intellectual property coordinators, digital learning fellows, and others. Gifts to MIT Open Learning directly support the sustainability and production of these courses. \nAt MIT Open Learning, we are committed to advancing best practices in education, conducting groundbreaking research, and engineering new platforms, like Open Learning Library, for the future of teaching and learning. With you and your support, we can prepare learners of all ages and future generations to meet tomorrow’s challenges and improve education at MIT and around the globe. \n Please support Open Learning with a gift today. If a gift isn’t possible at this time, you can also contribute by sharing your experience with Open Learning resources and what impact they have had in your life. \n Read more about our work in the annual impact report. \n \n \n \n \nI cannot overstate the impact that MIT Open Learning has had on my education. I have been a student of MOOCs for several years now, and the courses offered by MIT Open Learning have been some of the most impactful and useful that I have taken. I have been able to take courses on a wide variety of topics, and the quality of the content and the instructors has been consistently excellent. I have also been able to use the courses I have taken to further my career, as many of the topics covered are directly relevant to the work I do. I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to take advantage of MIT Open Learning, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a high-quality, affordable education.\n -Hikmat, Student - College/University, Nepal",
